# Instructions

Based on the discussion in class you will finish the experimental workflow for the case. You will create a one page figure illustrating workflow and any other relevant concepts. You will also include a brief written description of the workflow, no more than one page double spaced.

Some relevant points the figure and write up should address:

1. How will you make use of the fact you have a cohort of patients that are sensitive and resistant to treatment?
1. How exactly will you profile the genomes of these patients? What type of variants, potential tools, and samples collection will you use? What type of data generation will you do WGS, WTS, single cell, bulk etc? Why are you choosing those methods and what are the cost/benefits?
1. How and with what samples will you profile the clonal dynamic?
1. What experimental design will you use for the xenograft transplantation? How many patients will you derive xenografts from? What criteria are you using for selecting patients?
1. How do replication and controls factor into your design?
1. What are you ultimately trying to measure?
